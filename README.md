# testpypa
A repository to test various things for the Python Packaging Authority

The idea is to create subfolders for "Projects" with sample code and test package build options.
It is linked to my contributions to <https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/>.
Normally, nobody else apart members of the discussions there should waste its time looking at the files here.
